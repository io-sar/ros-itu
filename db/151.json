description:
	
	Cannot subsequently execute joint motion and set io through driver
	
    If a set of io commands is sent to the controller after a commanded joint motion, or a joint motion is sent to the controller after a set of io commands, 
	will trigger the following error : "Type error: resizing lists is not supported!".
	Because all the variables declared on the controller have a global scope and they cannot have their size changed once they created.
